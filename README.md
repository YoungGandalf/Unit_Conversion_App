# Unit_Conversion_App
Unit conversions are important in all sciences, although they may seem more critical in
chemistry because many calculations use different units of measurement. The objective of this Unit
Converter Application is to provide a user-friendly interface in an android environment for chemistry
students to convert bases, converting weights, and a temperature convertor/number system, as well as
any other useful conversions that a student would need. There could also be a tutorial section showing
the students how the calculations are done so they are able to learn. With Technology reaching its peak
time in this modern world, everything is being converted to our hands, why not make it more accessible.

HOW TO USE: 
○	Give a input value

○	Then select the submit button submitting the input value given

○	Now you can select your options from the drop down menus

○	From there you can change the menu according to what you want to convert to.
